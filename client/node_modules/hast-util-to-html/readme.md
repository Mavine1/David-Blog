## What is this?

This package is a utility that turns a hast tree into a string of HTML.

## When should I use this?

You can use this utility when you want to get the serialized HTML that is
represented by the syntax tree, either because you’re done with the syntax
tree, or because you’re integrating with another tool that does not support
syntax trees.

This utility has many options to configure how the HTML is serialized.
These options help when building tools that make output pretty (such as
formatters) or ugly (such as minifiers).

The utility [`hast-util-from-html`][hast-util-from-html] does the inverse of
this utility.
It turns HTML into hast.

The rehype plugin [`rehype-stringify`][rehype-stringify] wraps this utility to
also serialize HTML at a higher-level (easier) abstraction.
